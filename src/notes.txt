Ideas for improvement:
   - make special rules for the copula (desu)
   - change desu to -pol in places where it is just used as politeness. In the gold data
   - use synonyms of english words
   - filter definitions that are too long
   - add dictionary with names
   - allow translations to be correct as long as they contain the right word?
   - fix scoring
   - do something about w-question + ka
   - fix removal of "to"
