word/sentence segmenter: https://github.com/yanshao9798/segmenter
training data for segmenter: https://universaldependencies.org
aligning words (unsupervised): https://github.com/clab/fast_align
machine translation: http://opennmt.net/

Ideas for improvement:
   - make the translator get the correct type of word based on tokenizer pos!
   - use synonyms of english words
   - filter definitions that are too long
   - remove usage of parentheses from definition
   - remove "to" in definition e.g. "to eat" -> "eat"
   - add dictionary with names
   - remove "to" from translation of verbs
