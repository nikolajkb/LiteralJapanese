Ideas for improvement:
   - make special rules for the copula (desu)
   - change desu to -pol in places where it is just used as politeness. In the gold data
   - use synonyms of english words
   - do something about w-question + ka
   - use normalization to make making endings easier
   - use same dictionary for tokenization as translation
   - readings and writings separately
   - numbers
